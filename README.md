# Cooperative Contract Public Review
This repo is for publishing and requesting feedback on the contracts that are built into the Cooperativ platform. 

One of the advantages of using Cooperativ is that it offers easy-to-read, digital-native contracts built right into platform functions, like inviting a new contributor to join your project. We worked with our lawyers to provide what we intend to be fair, transparent language that aligns the interests of the parties and promotes creativity and the sharing of ideas. 

As part of our effort to offer the best possible legal structures, we have decided to make available in one place all of the standard legal language the platform offers. We invite all questions and public comment intended to make the contracts stronger and easier to read.
